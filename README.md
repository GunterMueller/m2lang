m2lang - The LLVM-based Modula-2 compiler
=========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redstar/m2lang.png?branch=master)][1]


Introduction
------------

See this [FOSDEM 2019 talk](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/llvm_irgen/) for some details.

Implementation decisions
------------------------

 - LLVM is only external dependency
 - CMake scripts derived from clang
 - PIM4 language first

Current status
--------------

- The lexer is almost done.
- The parser is based on ISO Modula-2 with generic and OO additions.
  It is not yet functional as there are some LL(1) conflicts left in the grammar.
- The parser is generated by my LLtool. A C++ port of LLtool will be integrated
  into this project to meet the goal that LLVM is the only external dependency.
- Diagnostics and error recovery is mostly missing.
- Only a dummy driver exists to see the parser in action.
